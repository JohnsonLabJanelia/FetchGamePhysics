# FetchGamePhysics

This repo is built upon [FetchGame](https://github.com/JohnsonLabJanelia/FetchGame). Many inspirations are taken from [Unity-Robotics-Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub), especially the [Pick-and-Place Tutorial](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/pick_and_place/README.md) and [Object Pose Estimation Tutorial](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Object-Pose-Estimation). A basic familiarity on these two tutorials and [ROS Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) would help better working with FetchGamePhysics.
